**Description of Assignment**: We coded a program in Arduino IDE that would run all the separate firefly patterns simultaneously on our Arduino board.
They are flashbulb, big dipper, and synchronous. The assignment also had 3 add on components, which were  
1. adding blue ghost, which is a pattern that continuously shines and changes brightness
2. changing big dipper so that the increase in brightness was not linear
3. making all fireflies match synchronous every 10 seconds when it flashes

**Tip**: This was a challenging assignment that was a lot of fun to figure out. The last add-on part of the assignment required tons of 
embedded condition checking. To make that part easier, write out in words (not even pseudocode) what you are trying to do and the sequence 
of conditions to check. That makes figuring the logic out easier.
