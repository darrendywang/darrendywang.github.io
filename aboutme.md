### Why eTextiles?
Starting in high school, I developed an interest in computer science. As someone who likes to build things, not knowing how to code or make circuits always placed a limit on what I wanted to make; however, I had a much greater love for biology and never developed this interest. When I was browsing the course catalog for Spring 2023, this course immediately caught my eye since it offers an opportunity to explore a more relavant and (subjectively) "fun" side of computer science. To me, this class seems to brush against what I understand engineering is about: bringing an idea to life through both making the physical object and coding its brain. I want to take away skills that can be applied when I want to design things that would make my life easier. (Ex: a moisture sensing self watering system for a vegetable bed)    
As for the sewing aspect of the class, I would love to learn more about proper stitching. I hate buying new things and would try to fix my own clothing if the damage isn't too bad. Learning actual sewing techniques would certainly increase my success rate and perhaps make the repairs more pleasing to look at.


### My current final project idea
My sleep schedule is heavily light-dependent: I like my room to be dark when I sleep, and I like to be woken up by natural light. My problem with sleep masks is that they don't allow sunlight to pass through. Therefore I want to 
1. put a clock with an alarm inside a sleep mask
2. hook that up to an LED
3. make the LED start getting brighter ~30 minutes before I want to wake up

So basically a sunrise clock but one that functions as an eyemask
