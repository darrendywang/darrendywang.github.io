### My name is Darren, I am

![random pic] (https://darrendywang.github.io/assets/img/IMG-6821.jpg)

- a Biology major (thesis on pollination networks) and Maritime Studies concentrator
- happiest when fishing, mushroom foraging, gardening, or enjoying quiet outdoors activities

### Why I am taking this class
I have tried to self-learn computer science a few times in the past, and the only thing that stuck is basic com-sci logic. Since I like to build things I also am interested in circuitry. This class seemed like it would be a good place to learn these two skills, and as a senior who's done with requirements I want to take a fun class.

### My current final project idea
My sleep schedule is heavily light-dependent: I like my room to be dark when I sleep, and I like to be woken up by natural light. My problem with sleep masks is that they don't allow sunlight to pass through. Therefore I want to 
1. put a clock with an alarm inside a sleep mask
2. hook that up to an LED
3. make the LED start getting brighter ~30 minutes before I want to wake up
