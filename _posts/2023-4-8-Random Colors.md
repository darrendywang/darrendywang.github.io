**Description of Assignment**: We wrote an arduino program that lights up an RGB LED with a random color everytime a button is pressed.
The light must stay on the same color until the switch is released

**Tip**: Having a Serial output for this assignment really helped since I could check whether I was getting
the correct output before moving on. Since I am pretty busy this weekend I did not attempt the extra credit. Am curious
how one would approach it since the two ideas I had don't seem very efficient.
