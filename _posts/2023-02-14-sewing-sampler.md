**My takeaway tip**: Make sure that the anchor knot is actually seated against the fabric after the initial 3-5 stitches. A few times I would be sewing along, flip the fabric, and realize that I needed to pull some stiches out since the beginning of the stitching was not secured properly.  
**Where I learend the stitches from**: *Cutesy Crafts* on YouTube.  
**What I enjoyed the most**: Sewing is relaxing. Nice to validate myself on my past attempts at mending my own clothing when I realized that the random stitches I used were legit and have names.
