**Description of Assignment**: We made two switches using LilyPad elements. One was made from a satin stitch stainless steel wire, and
the other one I made by hooking a fishhook onto a piece of conductive fabric on the wrong side. I also embroidered a fish.

**Tip**: If not required to make a switch using satin stitched stainless steel wire, **DO NOT**.  
The wire is thin, inflexible, and an absolute pain to work with. I'd much rather just stitch two pieces of conductive fabric.
