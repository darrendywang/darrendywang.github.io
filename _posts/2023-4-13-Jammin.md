**Description of Assignment**: We wrote an arduino program that plays a song (which we were allowed to take code from online) only when a switch is on the "on" position.
The song I chose is Fur Elise

**Tip**: Initially I couldn't get the music to stop playing even if the switch was off, and then I realized what was happening was there was a loop running through a HUGE
array that contained all the notes so it would not check the switch until it was done. After understanding what was going on, it was an easy fix. I guess that is a long
way of saying when replicating code, it is important to first read through each line to understand the original author's logic and approach, since it makes modifying 
the code to suit your purpose much easier rather than just slapping it in.
