**Description of Assignment**: We combined the 3 separate sparklies into one program so the LEDs on the arduino board lights up at the same time. 
The assignment also has 3 add on sections.
1. add blue ghost, which is a pattern that is continuously on and changing brightness
2. change big dipper to have a non linear brightness increase
3. make all LEDs match synchronous when it flashes every 10 seconds.

**Tip**: This was a challenging assignment that was fun to wrok through. The last add on part was particularly hard since you had to
do a lot of embedded conditional checks. My tip would be to write down in plain words (not even pseudocode) what conditions need to be
checked in what order. Thinking out loud what the behavior of the LEDs should be given case x,y,z,etc. really helped me understand what
sequence my embedded if's should be in.
