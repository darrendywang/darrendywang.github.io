Project Description: Paper prototype of my "Nap Mask" project. I drew what the components I'm going to use are, where they will be situated, 
and how they will be connected via conductive thread. I plan to sew all the components on a piece of felt (no fraying) and then attach that
onto a mask. I also drew it to be of scale to ensure all components can fit.
