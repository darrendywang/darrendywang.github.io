**Description of Assignment**: We wrote an arduino program that used arrays to either  
1) assigns a brightness value to a turned off PWN LED
2) turns a PWN LED off if it is on

**Tip**: choose variable names with purpose. This wasn't a complicated program but it did need quite a bit of variables 
I used "color" to indicate "brightness", which works but if I had to reuse the code it might not be super clear right away.
