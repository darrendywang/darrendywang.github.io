**Description of Assignment**: We made a program that uses a while loop to print out LED colors a limited number of times. I also used a series of if statements
to determine the color of the LED with a counter. The goal was to print a color every 10 numbers, and have colors rotate out after printing 3 times.

**Tip**: map out on paper first how you want to approach the problem. I originally had a if conditional with a modulo embedded in while loop
but realized later I can use runTimes in a more elegant way. Also drawing out how the program would "know" which color to print led me to
(one of) the correct answer(s).
