**Name**: Darren Wang  
**Year**: 2023  
**Major**: Biology, Concentration in Maritime Studies  
**Sewing experience**: very little with sewing machine, but good enough to mend my own clothing (roughly) with hand sewing.  
**Programming exp**: Have tried to self-learn a few times. All I've retained is the comp sci logic, nothing specific about the languages.  
**What I hope to learn in the class**: I like to make stuff, so circuitry is of particular interest to me. I would also like to brush up on coding logic.  
**Boring fact**: I tie my own flies for fly fishing.
