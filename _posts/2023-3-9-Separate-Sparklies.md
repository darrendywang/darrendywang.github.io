**Description of Assignment**: We made 3 arduino programs to mimic the glow of fireflies/ lightning bugs.  
*Flashbulb*: flashes 0.5 secs, then 3.5 secs off.  
*Big Dipper*: turns on every 3 secs, with glow getting brighter every 0.1 sec until max brightness.  
*Synchronous*: turns on every 10 secs, flashing 3 times for 0.2 secs with 0.1 sec between each flash.

**Tip**: It was hard getting used to a built in loop, especially in the case of synchronous in which I needed a while loop within the loop. 
I think the pseudocode really helped to figure out the logic first.
