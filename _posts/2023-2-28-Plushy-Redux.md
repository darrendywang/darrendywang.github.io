**Description of Assignment**: We redid the 3 LED plushy project but this time in C. Essentially practicing nested if statements to make 
checking multiple (two) conditions more streamlined

**Tip**: think about how to approach before you start coding. I almost wrote code to check for button status for switch == 0 but realized that would be unnecessary.
