**Description of Assignment**: We wrote an arduino program that uses the buzzer to play our names in morse code if a temporary switch is not pressed, 
and SOS when the switch is pressed.

**Tip**: This was a fun assignment that was very frustrating at the beginning. I could not figure out why the buzzer would not play the pauses, and after a lot
of experimentation I realized that the tone() function does NOT come built in with a delay function, so going directly from something like  

~~~
tone(buzz,freq,1000);
~~~  
into  
~~~
analogWrite(buzz,LOW);
delay(1000);
~~~   
does NOT give you buzz 1 sec, off 1 sec. It gives you an angry consistent buzz with short bursts of vibration. 
I never knew this about the function even though I had used it successfully in the past. So my tip to myself is to actually take time to understand
what the function parameters mean and what it actually does.
