**Description of Project**: We created a parallel circuit of 3 LEDs powered by a coin cell battery. The circuit also included a permanent switch and a temporary switch.
For the LEDs to light up, both switches need to be in the "on" position. The circuit is embedded on a felt plushy and connected with steel conductive wire. I backstitched
my initials on the plushy and sealed the sides with whip stitches.

**Paper Prototype**: the writing/drawing on the handout is unreadable so I redrew my final design.

**Alligator Prototype**: by the time I read the assignment rubric I was already too far ahead. Here are two pictures of the steel wire that sort of show
how the alligator clips were connected.

**Tip**: conductive wire is really hard to work with since it maintains its bends unlike normal thread. This makes handling the thread harder. My tip would
be go even slower than I would with normal thread and maintain just one place where the steel thread is kinked (where it goes through the eye of the needle).
