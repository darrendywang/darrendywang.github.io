**What is this assignment?** We made a if conditional program that recommends appropriate clothing depending on an input temperature. 
I read about this function called scanf() that allows for the user to input something through the console rather than actually typing in the temp in the code.  
**Tips for past self**: I started doing this after like the 2nd conditional, but just run one, make sure it works perfectly, and then copy paste.
